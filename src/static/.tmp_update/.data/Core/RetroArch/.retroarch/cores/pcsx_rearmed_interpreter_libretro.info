description = "A port of the PCSX-ReARMed fork to libretro. This emulator is a technical marvel and runs incredibly well on 32-bit ARM CPUs, though it is also a good choice for other low-powered hardware that cannot run Beetle-PSX/-HW or Swanstation at full speed. However, this core has no support for increased internal resolution, texture filtering, etc., so users who want those features would be better served by the other cores. This 'interpreter' variant of the core removes the CPU dynarec for compatibility at the cost of being much slower than the normal core."
