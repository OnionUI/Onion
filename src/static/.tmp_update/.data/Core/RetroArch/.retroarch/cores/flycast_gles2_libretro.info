description = "A port of the Flycast Dreamcast emulator to libretro. In addition to Dreamcast, the core also supports the NAOMI and Atomiswave arcade platforms (with appropriate BIOS images) and will load these games from the latest MAME ROMset. This particular Flycast variant is specially tuned for compatibility with older mobile GPUs that are limited to GLES2. Anyone with a more modern GPU should use a different version of the core."
