description = "A port of the Theodore emulator for the Thomson MO/TO system--a family of French 8-bit home computers--to libretro. This core emulates all of the main models of the MO/TO family, including the TO7, TO7/70, TO8, TO8D, TO9, TO9+, MO5 and MO6 models, as well as the Olivetti Prodest PC128, which is a rebranded MO6 that was released in the Italian market. The core includes an onscreen keyboard, which can be toggled with retropad-select and navigated using the d-pad and retropad-B to press the selected key."
