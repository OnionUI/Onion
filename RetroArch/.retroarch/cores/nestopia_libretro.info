description = "Nestopia is based on the most up-to-date code from the Nestopia-Undead emulator. This core strikes a good balance between performance and accuracy, with support for a wide variety of games and mappers. However, it needs the NstDatabase.xml to determine which games support the Zapper light gun and various other peripherals, as well as to pick certain mappers, so make sure you have that file in place to avoid unnecessary problems. In general, this core is a good choice for most users on desktop and mobile platforms."
