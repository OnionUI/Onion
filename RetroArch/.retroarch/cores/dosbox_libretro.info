description = "A port of the mature and well-known DOSBox emulator to libretro. This core is based on an older snapshot of the upstream code and, as a result, many users will have a better experience with the DOSBox-SVN, DOSBox-Core or DOSBox-Pure cores. This core provides a more traditional DOSBox experience vs the DOSBox-Pure core, which is focused on providing a turnkey, game-focused libretro experience."
