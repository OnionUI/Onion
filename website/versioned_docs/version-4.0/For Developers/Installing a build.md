## First install

Then you have to copy the files from `dist/full` or `dist/core` to your SD card, you can overwrite existing files, no need to clean some folders anymore.

The `dist/full` is the `core`, plus an updated version of RA, console icons, themes, and the ScummVM BIOS files.


## Updating the core

When you've installed the *fresh Onion*, you can just copy the files from the `build/.tmp_update` folder for testing subsequent builds.
