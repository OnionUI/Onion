## How to Get Involved

The Onion Dev Team are an open and friendly bunch that welcomes contributors and collaborators.

If you are a developer wishing to support the project by getting involved, or if you have a specific feature you would like to implement yourself, please feel free to reach out.

The best way to do this is to contact a member of the [Core Team](/about) by joining the _Retro Game Handhelds_ [discord server](https://discord.gg/Jd2azKX).
When you've joined the server, you will find a _Miyoo Mini_ [specific channel](https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/891336865540620338/) which also includes an [_Onion - Dev Thread_](https://discord.com/channels/529983248114122762/1007796369785897090) for development activities.
