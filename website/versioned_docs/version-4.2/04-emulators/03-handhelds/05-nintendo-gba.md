- Emulator: lr-gpsp, **lr-mgba**, lr-meteor, lr-mednafen-gba, lr-vba_next
- Rom Folder: `GBA`
- Extensions: `.bin` `.gba` `.zip` `.7z`
- Bios: `gba_bios.bin` (required for lr-gpsp, optional for other cores), `gb_bios.bin` (optional), `gbc_bios.bin` (optional), `sgb_bios.bin` (optional)

:::note
The default GBA emulator on Onion is currently mGBA. It has long provided optimum compatibility with the entire GBA game library. 

However, as gpSP continues to improve, it's preferable for the most demanding, slow or games requiring a better Fast Forward.

To use gpSP instead of mGBA, 2 possibilities:
- Use [GLO menu](../apps/game-list-options) to change the core for your selected game.
- Install gpSP emulator in expert section from [Package Manager](../apps/package-manager).
