:::tip Windows user?
Try [Onion Desktop Tools](https://github.com/schmurtzm/Onion-Desktop-Tools/blob/main/README.md) for easy SD card preparation and Onion installation. ODT makes it easy to format the SD card, download, install, update, and configure Onion in a couple of clicks.

*The firmware is the backend part of the OS, which lives inside your device. Onion on the other hand is a frontend that will stay fresh on your SD card.*

:::caution Risk of bricking
We can't take responsibility if your device is bricked in the process of upgrading the firmware.

Take a look at the [*firmware upgrade guide*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16885275/170205258-8add4be7-1a1e-4ae5-a8f2-cb13c6703e06.png) - beware, the guide contains an outdated link to lemiyoo.cn, we provide an alternative download link below.
:::

1. You can check your current version in `Settings` › `Device Info` › `Version`  
   or if you already have Onion installed: `Settings` › `About device` › `Firmware version`
2. Select your device in the tabs below, then check that you have the appropriate firmware version.

:::tip
If you experience any issues during the install, try copying over the installation
files again and re-run the installation (you can skip copying the `BIOS`,
`Icons`, and `Themes` folders).

If you still have issues after trying a reinstall, you may need to reformat
your SD card (remember to backup the `Roms` and `Saves` folders).
