# Fresh install


## Step 1: Preparing the SD card (only necessary first time)


:::caution Beware
The SD card included with the Miyoo Mini is known to be slow, and will likely ruin your experience and/or data.
Stick to using SD cards from reputable brands (e.g. SanDisk or Samsung).
:::

### Format your SD card as `FAT32` (not `exFAT`!)


<Tabs groupId="os" queryString>
<TabItem value="win" label="Windows">

If your SD card is larger than 32 GB, you need to use a third-party tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/):

1. In Rufus, select the device that corresponds with the SD card you want to format
2. Set **Boot selection** to `Non bootable`
3. **Partition scheme** should already be set to `MBR`
4. Set **File system** to `Large FAT32`
5. **Cluster size** at `32 kilobytes` should be fine (`16 kilobytes` might extend the life of your SD card)
6. Click **START** to format the card, when it's done you can close the window

:::info GUIFormat / fat32format
We do not recommend using *GUIFormat / fat32format*, since many users are reporting file system errors on cards above 128 GB

<TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">

On Mac, you can format your SD card with the built-in **Disk Utilities**:

1. Open **Application** › **Utilities** › **Disk Utilities**
2. From the sidebar, select the USB drive that corresponds with the SD card you want to format (Choose to format the root element [as on this picture](./assets/format-usb-to-fat32-on-mac.webp))
3. Choose **Erase** from the toolbar
4. Set **Format** › `MS-DOS (FAT)`
5. Set **Scheme** (if it exists) › `Master Boot Record`
6. Click **Erase** and wait for the process to finish

There are lots of ways to format an SD card on Linux. 3 methods are presented in [this blog post](https://www.golinuxcloud.com/steps-to-format-sd-card-in-linux/).

Make sure you choose: `For use with all systems and devices (FAT)`

## Step 2: Copy the installation files and boot up your device to begin the installation

2. Select and copy the 7 folders to the root of your SD card

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="Mac">

1. Unzip (expand) the `Onion-v4.x.x.zip` file: Double-click the `.zip` file.  
   The unzipped item will appear in the same folder as the `.zip` file.  
   If you want to, you can delete the `.zip` file.
2. Select and copy the 7 folders to the root of your SD card  
   Make sure hidden files are shown (press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>.</kbd> in Finder)

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

1. Unzip the `Onion-v4.x.x.zip` file using the following command (replace `Onion-v4.2.0` with the filename of the zip you downloaded):

   ```sh
   unzip Onion-v4.2.0.zip -d Onion-v4.2.0
   ```

2. Copy the 7 folders to your SD card, using the following command (replace `/run/media/mmcblk0p1` with the path to your SD card):

   ```sh
   cp -r Onion-v4.2.0/* /run/media/mmcblk0p1
   ```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="chromeos" label="Chrome OS">

1. Double-click the `Onion-v4.x.x.zip` file and make sure hidden files are visible by clicking or tapping the top-right corner 3-dots icon and making sure `Show Hidden Files` is toggled on.
2. Copy the 7 folders to your SD card, dragging them into your SD card drive icon on the left panel.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note Installation files
The Onion installation files consists of the following folders:
```sh showLineNumbers
.tmp_update/  # Might be hidden
BIOS/
Media/
miyoo/
miyoo354/
RetroArch/
Themes/
```
:::

3. Insert the SD card into the Miyoo device, and turn it on to begin the installation.
4. When the installation is done, you'll be prompted with the **Quick Guide** - *a quick overview of Onion*
5. Then you'll presented with the **Package Manager**, choose the systems and apps you want enabled, then press <kbd>START</kbd> twice
6. When the installation is done, press the <kbd>A</kbd> button and the device will turn off (MM) or reboot (MMP).


## Step 3: Copy over your bios and rom files

1. Copy your bios files to the `BIOS` folder (stock bios files are available at `RetroArch/.retroarch/system` on the stock SD card).  
2. Copy your roms into their respective subfolders in `Roms` (see the *[Emulators](../emulators)* page for more information - here you'll find the [Rom Folders](../emulators/folders) table).

:::info Part of the system
Despite its name, the `.tmp_update` folder must stay on your SD card.
:::

3. Insert your SD card, boot up your Mini and press <kbd>SELECT</kbd> › **Refresh all roms** from the **Games** tab in the main menu to refresh roms (forcing a reindex of your games).
