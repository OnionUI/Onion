## First install

You have to copy the files from `dist` to your SD card. You can just overwrite existing files, no need to clean any folders anymore.


## Updating the core

When you've installed the *fresh Onion*, you can just copy the files from the `build/.tmp_update` folder for testing subsequent builds.
