# Introducing the new Onion website!

We've finally moved away from using GitHub Wikis, and we're happy to introduce our shiny new website!

![](./assets/website-intro.png)

<!-- truncate -->

The new website introduces:
1. **Instant search** (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> for quick access)
2. **A souped up wiki** with bunch of awesome styles and functionalities
   - **Info boxes:** notes, tips, warnings, and info
   - **Tabs:** the installation guide now includes tabs for device model and OS type
   - **Embeds:** YouTube videos are now directly embedded on the page
   - **Better organization:** since we now have search, we can split stuff into multiple pages (like the [*Emulators*](../docs/emulators) page)
3. **A blog** for all our creative release notes, and soon even more interesting stuff
   - including a **comment section** on each post (powered by GitHub Discussions)
4. **Versioned documentation** - *Using an older version of Onion?* Go back in time and browse an older version of the Onion wiki!
5. **SEO** - this wiki should get picked up by Google (finally)! ðŸ˜…

We hope you'll find this new site a joy to use, and maybe even more impressive than our old wiki.
