# Introducing the new Onion website!

<img src={assets.image} />

*You're finally here.. good to see you traveler!*

We've moved away from the limited GitHub Wikis and over to GitHub Pages, and are happy to introduce our shiny new website!

<Truncate />

## New features

The new site is statically generated using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and offers a ton of amazing features:

1. **Instant search** (press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> for quick access)
2. **A souped up wiki** with a bunch of awesome functionality and page styles:
   - **Info boxes:** clearly marked notes, tips, warnings, and info boxes
   - **Tabs:** e.g. the installation guide now includes tabs for device model and OS type
   - **Embeds:** YouTube videos are directly embedded on the page
   - **Better organization:** since we have global site search, we can split stuff into multiple pages (like we've done with the [*Emulators*](../docs/emulators) page)
3. **A blog** for all our creative release notes, and soon even more interesting stuff
   - including a **comment section** on each post (powered by GitHub Discussions)
4. **Versioned documentation** - *Using an older version of Onion?* Go back in time and browse an older version of the Onion wiki!
5. **SEO** - this wiki should get picked up by Google (finally)! üòÖ

We hope you'll find this new site a joy to use, and even more impressive than our old wiki.
