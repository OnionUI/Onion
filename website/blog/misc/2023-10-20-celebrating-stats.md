# Celebrating FOSS and the Onion community

<img src={assets.image} />

I recently noticed a lot of our stats were looking pretty neat, so I decided to put them in a graphic, as I thought it was about time that we celebrated this amazing project.

The community engagement has been, and continues to be, amazing!

*Thank you, all!*
