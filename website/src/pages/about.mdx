## Origin

The idea of Onion was conceived on the [RGH](https://discord.gg/Jd2azKX) discord server on *December 16, 2021*, where user **Mevsi** joked that **shauninman** should do an april fools and release a green version of his custom frontend, *Union*, and call it Onion. At the time, **jimgray** was tinkering with a cleaner stock setup, and decided to name it Onion.

Totofaki joined the project soon after, and started developing the GameSwitcher and Activity Tracker. Within a short period of time he had shaped Onion into what we know it as today.
