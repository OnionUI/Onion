The Ports Collection allows you to have all your favourite ports located in one `Ports` *system* folder within the Games tab. 
Several ports are already configured for use with this feature (you will need to add your game files) and more will be added in future releases. 

Included Ports so far are: Cave Story, Doom, Doom 2, Duke Nukem 3D, Ganbare natsuki san, vvvvvv

See below regarding where to place your game files.
Also be sure to check out the [ports overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLOcA4o6WHU) by *RetroBreeze*, demonstrating how to set up Doom, Doom 2 and Duke Nukem with the collection feature.
