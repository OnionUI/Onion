Like Pico-8, Lowres NX, MicroW8 or LÖVE, [ChaiLove](https://docs.libretro.com/library/chailove/) is a framework for making 2D games. This Retroarch core uses the ChaiScript scripting language. 

However the compatibility is concerns to [a short list of Löve games](https://buildbot.libretro.com/assets/cores/ChaiLove/) (less than 10 games).

The most famous Chailove game is floppybird, a clone of Flappy Bird. The compatibility list also include interesting experimentations like [an app launcher](https://github.com/RobLoach/ChaiLove-Launcher).
