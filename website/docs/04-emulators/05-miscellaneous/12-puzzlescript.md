Like Pico-8, Lowres NX, MicroW8 or LÖVE, [PuzzleScript](https://www.puzzlescript.net/) is a framework for making 2D games. This Retroarch core uses the HTML5 language to allow you to create your own retro puzzles games. 

All games are free an open source. 
They have [an official game list here](https://www.puzzlescript.net/Gallery/index.html) but has also a real community which create many puzzles so you can find other games [here](https://philschatz.com/puzzlescript/) and on other places over the web! 

To add a game you need to dump its sources in a .pz file, it's well explained [here](https://github.com/nwhitehead/pzretro).
