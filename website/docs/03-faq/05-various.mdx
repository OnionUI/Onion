### Why Onion is <u>not a CFW (custom firmware)</u>?

</summary>

Onion doesn't modify the firmware of your Miyoo Mini so this is not a CFW. It can be considered more as an OS.
The way how your Miyoo Mini is booting will not change and it is a good thing because:
- it avoids the risk of bad flash.
- the original firmware of the Miyoo Mini starts up really fast !
After the boot, the first binary launched from the SD card by the firmware is the Onion scripts directly, making the boot of Onion OS fast and safe.

> Notes:  
> The community is working on [a real alternative firmware](https://github.com/orgs/miyoo-oss/repositories). It's currently not usable with Onion. The objective is to obtain a better control of the hardware part and a more recent linux kernel which could simplify the compilation of additional apps.

### How to <u>overclock</u> my Miyoo Mini?

</summary>

It is possible to overclock your device starting from Onion 4.2.0. The speed improvement can be up to 20% and is very noticeable. The current overclocking procedure is a manual process.

To overclock Retroarch for all cores, create a `cpuclock.txt` text file in the main Retroarch folder (e.g. `Retroarch/cpuclock.txt`) containing just the 4-digit Mhz number of the desired overclock speed (e.g. `1600`).

To overclock just a specific Retroarch core, create the `cpuclock.txt` text file within that core's configuration folder in `Saves/CurrentProfile/config/<core>/`. For example, if you want to improve the PSX speed of PCSX-ReARMed (which will allow you to enable *enhanced resolution* for many additional games) you can create a `cpuclock.txt` file containing `1600` inside `Saves/CurrentProfile/config/PCSX-ReARMed/`.

The maximum device overclock speeds are:
- Miyoo Mini: 1700Mhz (1600 recommended for optimal stability)
- Miyoo Mini Plus: 1900Mhz (1800 recommended for optimal stability)

:::warning

Using values higher than the recommended ones will impact stability or damage your device.
