### How can I <u>add box art</u> or screenshot images for my games?

</summary>

Onion has a built-in scraper (MMP only):

1. When inside a game list, press <kbd>Y</kbd> to access GLO
2. Scroll down and find the "Scraper" option

If you have a regular Mini, or just want to scrape images off-device, follow this guide:
- [Scraping artwork for games](advanced/scraping)

### How can I <u>add manuals</u> for my games?

</summary>

Just add a `Manuals` folder containing pdf files named with the same names as the roms.

For example: 

- 📁`Roms/GB/`
  - 📄`Tetris.gb`
  - 📁`Manuals/`
    - 📄`Tetris.pdf` 

1. When inside a game list, select a rom and press <kbd>Y</kbd> to access [GLO menu](/docs/apps/game-list-options)
2. Scroll down and find the "Game manual" option

It will run Green pdf reader with the manual of the selected rom.

:::note
The *Game manual* option is not displayed in GLO menu if the pdf file doesn't exist or if it is not wall named (the files names are key sensitive).

### How can I use a `miyoogamelist.xml` to <u>customize game names</u>?

</summary>

Onion uses a 'miyoogamelist.xml' (in the same format as the more common 'gamelist.xml').
To create a miyoogamelist, review [the guide here](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/files/9050638/miyoogamelist.20220607.pdf).

> Troubleshooting: 
> After adding the miyoogamelist.xml to your rom folder you will need to `Refresh all roms` from the Games tab (press <kbd>SELECT</kbd> to open the context menu). 
> If the list is still not being loaded, ensure that the `extlist` in the `Emu/<systemname>/config.json` is populated with all appropriate rom extensions for your games (i.e. `"extlist":"zip|ZIP"`)

> Important: 
> The guide includes a "cleanup" script for use with [xmlstarlet](http://xmlstar.sourceforge.net/) but an issue with viewing PDF files in a browser means the script does not copy well. Either open the PDF in a reader application (i.e. Adobe Acrobat) or use [this batch file](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/files/9050636/gamelist.xml-to-miyoogamelist.xml-Clean-Up-Script.zip) to run the script


**Note**: There is an **alternate method** of creating the '**miyoogamelist.xml**' file using a simple _PowerShell script_ which does not have any 3rd party dependencies other than Windows and PowerShell itself. There are _two versions_ of the script which are , depending on your preferences:
* [More human readable, less efficient](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/blob/main/files/20230617/New-MiyooGameListXmlFormatted.ps1).
* [Less human readable, more efficient](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/blob/main/files/20230617/New-MiyooGameListXml.ps1).

The more efficient version of the script strips out all formatting and indenting and produces a considerably smaller file size, which theoretically allows Onion to parse and process the data faster.

### I have added new roms to my SD card, why are the <u>games not showing up</u>?

</summary>

Any time you add rom files to your SD card you will need to 'refresh your roms' to rebuild game list cache files:  
* From the `Games` tab in the main menu, press the <kbd>SELECT</kbd> button. 
* This will evoke the 'Refresh All Roms' menu option, press <kbd>A</kbd> to confirm.   

> Please review our [Rom Files](/docs/emulators#rom-files) section for some additional guidance and tips.   
> If newly added games are still not appearing, ensure that you have placed them in the [correct rom folders](/docs/emulators/folders).  
> Rom folder names for each system must be capitalized and may differ from those on the stock Miyoo SD card.   
> Also review the [Emulators Section](/docs/emulators) to ensure you are using supported rom formats, as documented per system.

### How do I add game <u>cheats</u>?

</summary>

<sup>(Credit: Erazemk)</sup>

This guide will teach you how to add cheats for your RetroArch emulators.

Your first task is to find cheat files for your games (usually provided in `.cht` format). You can find them fairly easily online, but the recommended source is [LibRetro database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database), which has up-to-date cheats for most LibRetro supported emulators.

1. Download the <IconLink href="https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" icon="folder_zip">database repository as a ZIP file</IconLink>,
2. Extract it and go into the `cht` directory (you will see cheats sorted by console),
3. Copy directories for consoles you want to your Miyoo Mini's SD card, into the `RetroArch/.retroarch/cheats` directory (you might have to enable showing hidden directories if you can't see the `.retroarch` directory),
4. Inside the `.retroarch` directory there will be a `retroarch.cfg` file, which you need to open in a text editor. Find the line with the option `quick_menu_show_cheats` and set it to `"true"` (so the whole line should be `quick_menu_show_cheats = "true"`),
5. Eject your SD card from your computer and plug it into the Miyoo Mini, then open up your favourite game (for which you have downloaded cheats),
6. Enter the RetroArch menu (press `Menu`, hold it, then press `Select`) and find the `Cheats › Load Cheat File (Replace)` option. There you can find the cheat file in one of the directories. After choosing it you will be returned back to the cheats menu, but now you should see a number of cheats at the bottom (e.g. `Cheat #0`),
7. Select one of them, then toggle the `Enabled` switch to enable it.

### What is the optimal way to <u>organize multi-disk games</u>?

</summary>

<sup>(Credit: Schmurtz)</sup>

PSX multidisc roms require to create a playslist file (.m3u). It allows to have only one entry for each multidisc game and one unique save file for each game.
Since Onion 4.3.0 you can use Tweaks app to generate automatically the m3u playlist files which will group your multidisk games.

The tool is available from `Tweaks` -> `Tools` section.
By default the script is systematically applied to `PS`, `SEGACD`, `NEOCD`, `PCE`, `PCFX` and `AMIGA` rom folders.

The supported multidisc file names are numerous (not key sensitive and support "disc" or "disk"), for example: 
 - `MyGame (Disc 1).chd` or `MyGame (disc 1).chd` or `MyGame (DISC 1).chd` or `MyGame (Disk 1).chd`
 - `MyGame (USA) (Disc 1).bin` + `MyGame (USA) (Disc 1).cue`
 - `MyGame (USA) (Disc 1) (Rev 1).chd`
 - `MyGame (Disc 1 of .2).chd`
...


When you run multidisc playlist (.m3u) generator from Tweaks app, it will propose you 2 solutions to hide the multidisk roms files (and keep only the playlist visible). 
- Multiple directories (.Game_Name)  ---> One directory for each game: "`.Game_Name`".
- Single directory (.multi-disc) ---> One single directory "`.multi-disc`" will contains all multi-disc files.

:::note
This choice has no impact on the daily use experience: it's up to you to choose the file storage that suits you best.
:::

<br /><br />

**Example:** With "Driver 2" and "Metal Gear Solid"

Copy the bin/cue or chd files for the multi-disc games *Driver 2* and *Metal Gear Solid* into the following folder of `Roms/PS`. You'll obtain:


<table><td>

- 📁`Roms/PS/`
  - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 1) (v1.1).cue`
  - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 1) (v1.1).bin`
  - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 2) (v1.1).cue`
  - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 2) (v1.1).bin`
  - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Disc 1) (Rev 1).chd`
  - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Disc 2) (Rev 1).chd`

</td></table>

Result after running multidisc playlist (.m3u) generator from Tweaks app:

- if you choose *Multiple directories (.Game_Name)*

<table><td>

- 📁`Roms/PS/`
  - 📄`Driver 2 (v1.1).m3u`
  - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Rev 1).m3u`
  - 📁`.Driver 2 (v1.1)/`
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 1) (v1.1).cue` 
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 1) (v1.1).bin`
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 2) (v1.1).cue`
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 2) (v1.1).bin`
  - 📁`.Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Rev 1)/`
    - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Disc 1) (Rev 1).chd`
    - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Disc 2) (Rev 1).chd`

</td></table>

- if you choose *Single directory (.multi-disc)*

<table><td>

- 📁`Roms/PS/`
  - 📄`Driver 2 (v1.1).m3u`
  - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Rev 1).m3u`
  - 📁`.multi-disc/`
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 1) (v1.1).cue` 
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 1) (v1.1).bin`
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 2) (v1.1).cue`
    - 📄`Driver 2 (Disc 2) (v1.1).bin`
    - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Disc 1) (Rev 1).chd`
    - 📄`Metal Gear Solid (USA) (Disc 2) (Rev 1).chd`

### How can I <u>rename or rearrange consoles</u> or systems?

</summary>

The name of each console or system is defined in `Emu/[systemname]/config.json` 
You can edit this file with a text editor on your PC and apply a new name by updating the 'label' field.

To easily make bulk changes to your console or system names you can also use the excellent python scripts below by Andrea922.
Visit the [onionos-console-renamer github](https://github.com/Andrea922/onionos-console-renamer) to download and follow the instructions detailed there.  

> Notes:  
> Systems in Onion OS are displayed in alphabetical order so the name will determine where in your list it sits.   
> An alternative method to order the systems is by adding an equal number of spaces both sides of the label name.  
> The number of spaces determines the position it is displayed on the Mini, with the most spaces being first.  
> For example, _"   Arcade   "_ will appear before _"Arcade"_.
