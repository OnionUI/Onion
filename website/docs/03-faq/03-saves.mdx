### How do I <u>add game saves</u>?

</summary>

You can copy in-game save files from another device or emulator for use in OnionOS. 
* In most cases, Save files should be in `.srm` format, named identically to the rom and are case sensitive. Note that `.sav` files can be renamed to `.srm`, other formats may require a conversion tool. 
* To add your saves to OnionOS just copy your individual save files into the correct emulator folder in: `Saves/CurrentProfile/saves/[CORENAME]`
* If you have already launched the game prior to adding your saves then you will also need to go to the `Saves/CurrentProfile/states/[CORENAME]` folder ...and delete any Save States here for the same game(s) in order for your newly added game saves to be recognised.

> `[CORENAME]` = The folder with name of the RA core for the particular emulator or system the save file(s) relates to.     
> If copying saves from your Miyoo stock SD card, or an early version of Onion, you will find your saves in `RetroArch/.retroarch/saves/[CORENAME]`

### How do I <u>delete save states</u>?

</summary>

Save States are stored inside `Saves/CurrentProfile/states/[CORENAME]/`

> Notes:

### How do I <u>disable auto-load</u> save states?

</summary>

- Launch the game and press <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>SELECT</kbd> to go into the RetroArch menu.  
- Press <kbd>B</kbd> to go back one level.  
- Go to `Setting` › `Saving` › `Load State Automatically` (and turn it off).  
- Press <kbd>B</kbd> twice to go back to the main menu.  
- Then go to `Quick Menu` › `Overrides` and select one of the following:  
      - `Save Game Overrides` - for just this game.  
      - `Save Core Overrides` - for everything the core plays.  
      - `Save Content Overrides` - for everything in the same Rom folder.  

> Notes:  
> `Content Overrides` are recommended over `Core Overrides` since some cores serve multiple systems. 
> For more information regarding RetroArch overrides please review the [libretro documentation here](https://docs.libretro.com/guides/overrides/).

### Why does my <u>state slot number</u> get so high? Does it take up a lot of space on my SD?

</summary>

Onion enables a feature that retains your old Save States.  
  
In case of manipulation error, file corruption, or simply because you want to return to an earlier section of the game, it is possible to go back in time to select an earlier Save State. This takes up very little space on your SD as even if your Save State slot number is high, RetroArch will only retain the last 10 files.  

To manage your current Save State slot:  

- Launch the game and press <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>SELECT</kbd> to go into the RetroArch menu. 
- Go to `Save States` > `State Slot` and change the slot number with <kbd>Dpad Left</kbd> or <kbd>Dpad Right</kbd>  
  (Tip: Pressing <kbd>Y</kbd> here will show a full screen image capture for the Save State) 
- You can alternatively manage the slot number 'in-game' by pressing <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>Dpad Left</kbd> or <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>Dpad Right</kbd> and then pressing either:  
   - <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>L2</kbd> to load from the slot you selected  
   - <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>R2</kbd> to save to (and overwrite) the slot you selected  

> Save state slot `-1` is reserved for Onion's Auto-Save feature.   
> Manual save states start counting from slot `0` upward. If your slot has reached a particularly high number and you would like to reduce it, you can manually change the slot in the RA Quick Menu menu. Switching back to slot '0' and making a manual save will mean it starts counting again incrementally from there.  

> If you wish to forgo the advantages of incremental Save States mentioned above, you may disable them as follows:
> - Launch a game and press <kbd>MENU</kbd>+<kbd>SELECT</kbd> to go into the RetroArch `Quick Menu`
> - Press <kbd>B</kbd> once, to go to RA `Main Menu`
> - Go to `Settings` > `Saving` > `Increment Save State Index Automatically` (and toggle this off)
> - Press <kbd>B</kbd> twice and go to `Quick Menu` > `Overrides` to [save the RA settings](emulator-settings#how-do-i-save-retroarch-settings)
