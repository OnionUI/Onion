- Virtual password auth. 

- Command-Line Interface

- Scripting and automation

- Debugging and troubleshooting

- Encrypted


## Enabling SSH

You'll find it in **Apps** › **Tweaks** › **Network** › **SSH: Secure shell** 

You can either use the master toggle to turn the SSH server on with your Right/Left arrows, or press A to enter the submenu.

In the submenu you'll get 2 options:

1. **Enable** - Activate SSH access

2. **Enable authentication** - Activate authentication (username/password)

## Logging in

:::note Default credentials
**Username:** `onion`  
**Password:** `onion`  
*We're using a new auth system, user defined passwords will come in a future update.*
:::

Once you've activated your SSH server in Tweaks you'll now be able to connect using software such as PuTTY, SolarPuTTY, Hyperterm. You'll also be able to use an SFTP client to transfer files securely

If you connect using the integrated ssh client in Windows or Linux, you might get this error:

```
Unable to negotiate with x.x.x.x port 22: no matching key exchange method found.
```

To fix this, you need to specify the **key exchange** and **host key algorithm** by adding the correct arguments:

```sh
ssh onion@IPADDRESS -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa
```

If you connect from Fedora, some versions of SSH will fail to connect with the error:

```sh
Unable to negotiate with x.x.x.x port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss
```

To fix this, try specifying the accepted key types with:

```sh
ssh onion@IPADDRESS -oKexAlgorithms=+diffie-hellman-group1-sha1 -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa
```

Replace `IPADDRESS` accordingly.

You'll need the IP of the device, found below (**Tweaks** › **Network**).

## Disabling authentication

Although this is not recommended on other peoples Wi-Fi, when you're at home on your own Wi-Fi this is absolutely fine (or any other secure Wi-Fi!)

Head over to **Tweaks** › **Network** › **SSH** and toggle:

## Security

:::caution Network security
Although we've taken every precaution to offer as much security as possible, remember to keep your Onion safe. SSH/SFTP is the most secure of the services Onion offers to communicate with your device but it is not advisable to leave SSH enabled while using public/open Wi-Fi unless you're actively using it.
