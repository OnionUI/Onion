The FB cores are a good alternative to MAME, they may not run as many games but you may find _some_ games are more accurate in FB. 

FBNEO is the latest FB core and as such it has higher hardware expectations (beyond the mini for some games). While many games will run fine in FBNEO, you may see better performance (at the cost of accuracy) in FBA2012 which performs better on lower powered devices.  

For best game compatibility, seek out the recommended romsets above. Alternative romsets for Final Burn cores may be largely compatible (i.e. v0.2.97.24, v0.2.97.39, v0.2.97.40, v0.2.97.44).
