# Sinclair - ZX-81 âš 

- Emulator: lr-81
- Rom Folder: `ZXEIGHTYONE`
- Extensions: `.p` `.tzx` `.zip`
- Bios: None

I was only able to successfully load `.p` based roms. I suggest using `.p` roms and `.zip` files with `.p` roms in them based on my testing.

Many games can be started by pressing <kbd>SELECT</kbd> to bring up the virtual keyboard, press <kbd>R</kbd> then <kbd>RETURN</kbd>. Otherwise, you'll need to search online on how to load these games if you're not familiar with this system.
