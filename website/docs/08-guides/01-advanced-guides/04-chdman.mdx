# CHDMAN

*Convert your CD roms into a lossless compressed format.*

:::tip Preferred format
CHD is the preferred format for SEGA CD, PS1, and PC Engine games. Sometimes you can get up to **50% smaller** files!
:::

> CHD is a lossless compression format originally developed for MAME, for the hard-drive contents of certain arcade machines.
> It has since been used in several other emulators as a means of storing CD-ROM game data.
