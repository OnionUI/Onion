# Editing docs

## Prerequisites

To clone and build the website all you need is *git*, and [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

Start by cloning [a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the Onion repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Onion.git
```

Go to the `website` directory:

```sh
cd Onion/website
```

Use your preferred package manager to install the dependencies:

<Tabs groupId="pm" queryString>
<TabItem value="npm">


```sh
npm install
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">


```sh
yarn install
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Serving the website locally

To instantly preview your changes on save, you can serve the website locally using this command:

<Tabs groupId="pm" queryString>
<TabItem value="npm">


```sh
npm start
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">


```sh
yarn start
```


</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Editing content

Now you're ready to start editing the docs! Open the `website/docs` directory (or any of the markdown files inside) in your favorite text editor, for example **Visual Studio Code**:

```sh
code docs/
```

### Notes on the file structure

The markdown files inside the `docs` directory each represent a page on the website. These are divided into categories and subcategories. The number prefixes on the categories and pages decides the order in which they are shown in the sidebar.

Some of the markdown files are using the `.mdx` extension, these have simply been supercharged with support for [MDX (Markdown + React)](https://www.docusaurus.io/docs/markdown-features/react) syntax.

Some of the subcategories contain an `index.md` or `index.mdx` file, these represent the main landing page for each subcategory.


## Propose changes via a Pull Request (PR)

Push your changes to a fork of the Onion repo and create a PR to the main repo.
