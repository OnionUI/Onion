### Region selection:
Choose your prefered region. If no media is found for your country code, other countries will be searched as fallback.



### Scraping source:
Select where the covers will be searched.
- ScreenScraper is probably the best supplied, it supports all the media types proposed in Scraper and it also allows to search by CRC which provide a lot of additional matches.
- Launchbox offers a fast alternative to ScreenScraper.
- Retroarch is quite fast the the match level is low.

### Screenscraper: account settings

- Screenscraper information: technical information about ScreenScraper (a retrogaming project to support).
- Username & password: to set your ScreenScraper credentials.
- Account state and stats: will show your screenscraper account state  (useful to check if your account credentials are well configured and if you don't exceed quotas).

Allows to download covers in background, which means that you can use your Miyoo Mini Plus while it is downloading your covers.
