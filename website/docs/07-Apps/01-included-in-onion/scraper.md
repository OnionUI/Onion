### Region selection
Choose your prefered region. If no media is found for your country code, other countries will be searched as fallback.



### Scraping source
Select where the covers will be searched.
- ScreenScraper is probably the best supplied, it supports all the media types proposed in Scraper and it also allows to search by CRC which provide a lot of additional matches.
- Launchbox offers a fast alternative to ScreenScraper.
- Retroarch is quite fast the the match level is low.

### Screenscraper: account settings

- Screenscraper information: technical information about ScreenScraper (a retrogaming project to support).
- Username & password: to set your ScreenScraper credentials.
- Account state and stats: will show your screenscraper account state  (useful to check if your account credentials are well configured and if you don't exceed quotas).

### Toggle background Scraping

Allows to download covers in background, which means that you can use your Miyoo Mini Plus while it is downloading your covers.
