# Upgrading


*When upgrading, your save states, in-game saves, roms, bios files, and
configs will carry over to the updated system.*

:::note OTA UPDATES (MMP)
The Miyoo Mini+ (Plus) can update Onion via the Wi-Fi connection using the OTA Update app. If the OTA update fails, simply follow the steps below to perform a manual update.
:::


## Step 1: Copy the installation files

:::caution Save state compatibility
For some systems, save states won't always work after upgrading,
please **make sure to create in-game saves** before upgrading.

   ```sh
   unzip Onion-v4.2.0.zip -d Onion-v4.2.0
   ```

2. Copy the 7 folders to your SD card, using the following command (replace `/run/media/mmcblk0p1` with the path to your SD card):

   ```sh
   cp -rf Onion-v4.2.0/* /run/media/mmcblk0p1
   ```

:::tip Recommended method
Due to limitations in the way the Chrome OS File Manager works, it's recommended to backup your personal files, perform a clean install of Onion OS on the SD card, and then restore your backed up files. The following instructions go through this procedure.
:::

1. Display the contents of the SD card on the File Manager by double-clicking the drive icon.
2. Backup your personal files such as the ones under `Roms`, `BIOS`, `Saves` and `Themes` directories.
3. Perform a [clean install](/docs/installation/fresh) on the SD card.
4. Restore your files on the newly installed Onion SD card. **Do not move a file to the same location as one with the same name**. This will cause the moved file to be duplicated with a number appended to it, and won't be recognized by Onion OS. 

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If you're upgrading from v3.9 or below, we recommend you delete the `.tmp_update` folder first.
:::


## Step 2: Boot up your device to begin the installation

1. The installation will begin when you boot up your Miyoo Mini.

2. When the installation is done, press the <kbd>A</kbd> button and the device will turn off (MM) or reboot (MMP).


## Step 3: Check that your files are in the correct folders

1. If they're not already in place, transfer your bios files to the `BIOS` folder and your roms in their respective subfolders inside the `Roms` folder (see the *[Emulators](../emulators)* page for more information - here you'll find the [Rom Folders](../emulators/folders) table).

:::info
Despite its name, the `.tmp_update` folder must stay on your SD card.
:::

2. Insert your SD card, boot up your Mini and press <kbd>SELECT</kbd> from the `Games` tab in the main menu to refresh roms.
