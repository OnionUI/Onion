## Logging in

Once you've activated your file server in Tweaks (and exited tweaks!) you'll now be able to browse to the IP address of your device.
If you're not sure what the IP address is, you'll find it at the top of the "Network" page within Tweaks.

Open up your preferred web browser and browse to the IP address!
You'll be met with the below, at which point you can login with the default username of `admin` and password of `admin`.


## Disabling authentication

Head over to **Tweaks** › **Network** › **HTTP file server** and toggle:
