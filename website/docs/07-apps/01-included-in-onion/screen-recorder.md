## Features

- Record your current screen
- Recording indicator icon
- Customizable countdown before starting recording

:::note
Not really suitable to record games in current build as it's CPU encoding and the framerate is too low for a game.

    - Toggle indicator icon: Flashes/Shows an icon to remind you that you're recording
    - Toggle hotkey: Enables or disables the hotkey to start/stop recording (Hold MENU+A for 2 seconds)
    - Reset screen recorder: Hardkills ffmpeg, removes all flags and stops any recording
