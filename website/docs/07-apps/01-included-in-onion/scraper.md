<sup>SS = ScreenScraper, LB = LaunchBox, RA = RetroArch</sup>


### Region selection
Choose your preferred region. If no media is found for your country code, other countries will be searched as fallback.



### Scraping source
Select where the covers will be searched.
- ScreenScraper is probably the best supplied, it supports all the media types proposed in Scraper and it also allows to search by CRC which provide a lot of additional matches
- LaunchBox offers a fast alternative to ScreenScraper
- RetroArch is quite fast but the match level is low.

### ScreenScraper: account settings

- ScreenScraper information: technical information about ScreenScraper (a retrogaming project to support)
- Username & password: to set your ScreenScraper credentials
- Account state and stats: will show your ScreenScraper account state (useful to check if your account credentials are well configured and if you don't exceed quotas)

### Toggle background Scraping

Allows to download covers in background, which means that you can use your Miyoo Mini Plus while it is downloading your covers.
