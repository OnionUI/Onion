# Game List Options (GLO)

*Make actions on your game list*

## Presentation
Game List Options (GLO menu) is a tool for performing actions for the selected game or for the entire list. <br />
Press <kbd>Y</kbd> in a game list then from this menu you can choose the RetroArch core, download the image cover of your game (WiFi/MMP required), launch a Netplay session, reset your game (to skip the last save state), filter the list of games with a keyword,...

Thanks to GLO menu flexibility, you can even add your own scripts here!

## Usage

GLO Menu is a native application of Onion, it is installed by default.

## Advanced

GLO Menu allows you to create your own scripts.
The GLO scripts are located in `sdcard/App/romscripts`. 

The existing scripts are a great source of inspiration for your future script. Here some examples: 
- [Scraper script](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/blob/main/static/build/App/romscripts/emu/Scraper.sh): good example to use rom path
- [Random game script](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/blob/main/static/packages/App/Random%20Game/App/romscripts/Random%20game.sh): good example to get the current section
- [Netplay script](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/blob/main/static/build/App/romscripts/emu/Netplay.sh): good example for dynamic labels entry in GLO menu


*Some useful variables: *

- `require_networking=1`: will show this GLO entry only on the MMP which is equipped of WiFi
- `%LIST%`: is the name of the current system (for example GENESIS)
- `$1`: will contain the full path of the selected rom 
- `$2`: will contain the full path of the current emulator
