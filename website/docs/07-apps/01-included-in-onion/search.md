- You can start search using the `X` button by default. You can change this keybinding in Tweaks
- *Note: For now only verified systems are supported (the ones that are in the `Games` tab).*
- When a search is active, the results will be shown under `Games` â€º `Search`, you can remove the search again by choosing "Clear search".
- "Missing caches" lists all systems which haven't been cached yet, and thereby haven't been included in the search.
  - *Reason:* All game caches are cleared everytime you "Refresh all roms".
  - *Solution:* Go into each system you want included in the search.
