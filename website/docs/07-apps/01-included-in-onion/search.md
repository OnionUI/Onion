## Presentation

The Search application is the perfect companion for large game collections. It lets you find all the games containing the keyword you've entered.
Search also allows to filter a game list to include only games containing a specific keyword.

## Usage

#### **Search**

- You'll find Search under `Apps` - and it's a popular choice for mapping to <kbd>X</kbd> (configured by default in Onion) or <kbd>Y</kbd> (via Tweaks)
- You can start search using the `X` button by default. You can change this keybinding in Tweaks
- When a search is active, the results will be shown under `Games` â€º `Search`, you can remove the search again by choosing "Clear search"
- "Missing caches" lists all systems which haven't been cached yet, and thereby haven't been included in the search
  - *Reason:* All game caches are cleared everytime you "Refresh all roms"
  - *Solution:* Go into each system you want included in the search


#### **Filter**

- *Filter* is accessible via the `GLO Menu` When in a game list, press <kbd>Y</kbd>
  - **Filter:** Will prompt you to enter a keyword for filtering the selected game list
  - In your filtered game list you will find 3 new options:
    - **~Clear filter:** Will remove the current filter to display your full game list again
    - **~Filter: "keyword":** Run filter app again to quickly modify your keywork
    - **~Refresh roms:** Will refresh roms only for the current filtered game list
- *Note: If you're using a `miyoogamelist.xml` you will need to add an entry for `~Filter.miyoocmd` and `~Refresh roms.miyoocmd`*
