The GameSwitcher is designed to be the central user interface of Onion.

The last game played will be resumed in a few seconds, and with the simple press of a button, save your progress and turn off the console.  
It also allows you to quickly change games and many other features:

- Quick boot your last played game.
- Quickly switch games from your history.
  - Remove a game by pressing <kbd>X</kbd>.
- Full overlay with accurate brightness, battery readings and playtimes.
  - Press <kbd>SELECT</kbd> to toggle playtime display.
- **Minimal view mode:** Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to toggle.
- Improved *Sleep Mode* with full game suspension (press <kbd>POWER</kbd>).
- Low battery indicator: Red frame when <15% (can be adjusted in Tweaks).
- When the battery goes below 4%, the device will automatically save and exit to prevent losing progress.
