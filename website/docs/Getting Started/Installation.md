- **Important:** The April 2022 firmware from Miyoo (version `202204******`) is needed for Onion v3.10 and above.
- You can check your current version in `Settings` › `Device Info` › `Version`.
  - *Most devices produced after July 2022 will already have the latest firmware.*
  > ***Info:** The firmware is the backend part of the OS, which lives inside your device. Onion on the other hand is a frontend that will stay fresh on your SD card.*

We can't take responsibility if your device is bricked in the process of  
upgrading the firmware. Take a look at the [*firmware upgrade guide*](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16885275/170205258-8add4be7-1a1e-4ae5-a8f2-cb13c6703e06.png).

If you can't or don't want to update the firmware, there are other alternatives  
like installing an older version of Onion or MiniUI.

- Download the [latest version of Onion](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/releases/latest) from the release page.

### Step 1: Preparing the SD card (only necessary for first use)
- Stick to using SD cards from reputable brands (e.g. SanDisk or Samsung).
  > *The SD card included with your Miyoo Mini is known to be slow, and will likely ruin your experience and/or data.*
- Format your SD card as `FAT32`
  > **Note:** This is not the same format as `exFAT`.
  > If your SD card is larger than 32 GB, we recommended using a tool like [guiformat](http://ridgecrop.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) or [rufus](https://rufus.ie/).

### Step 2: Copy the installation files and boot up your device to begin the installation
- Extract the contents of the [`Onion-v4.x.x.zip`](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/releases/latest) file and copy everything to your SD card.
- The installation will begin when you boot up your Miyoo Mini.
- When the installation is done, press any button and the device will turn off.

### Step 3: Copy over your bios and rom files
- Copy your bios files into the `BIOS` folder (from `\RetroArch\.retroarch\system` on the Miyoo SD Card).  
- Copy your roms into their respective folder in `Roms` (see the *[[Emulators]]* page for more information).  
- Do NOT delete the `.tmp_update` folder, despite its name this must stay on your SD card.

</td><td>

**When upgrading, your save states, in-game saves, roms, bios files, and  
configs will carry over to the updated system.**

For some systems, ex. *gpSP*, save states won't always work after upgrading,  
please **make sure to create in-game saves** before upgrading, then you can  
delete any non-working save states after upgrading.

### Step 1: Copy the installation files
- Extract the contents of the [`Onion-v4.x.x.zip`](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/releases/latest) file and copy everything to your SD card.
  - Click "Yes" when prompted to overwrite (or "Merge" if you're on Mac).

### Step 2: Boot up your device to begin the installation
- The installation will begin when you boot up your Miyoo Mini.
- If you've already got Onion installed, you'll get prompted with 3 choices:
  - **Update (keep settings):** This will update Onion, RetroArch, emulators, and apps.
  - **Reinstall (reset settings):** Will install everything as above, but will additionally reset all settings.
  - **Update OS/RetroArch only:** Only update Onion system files and RetroArch.
    > ***Emulators, apps, and configs will stay untouched.** This can possibly yield some incompatibilities, depending on which version you're upgrading from.*
- ***Note:** If you're upgrading from v3.9 or below, we recommend you choose "Reinstall".*
- When the installation is done, press any button and the device will turn off.

### Step 3: Check that your files are in the correct folders
- If they're not already in place, make sure to put your bios files in the `BIOS` folder and roms in their respective subfolder inside the `Roms` folder (see the *[[Emulators]]* page for more information, here you'll find the [Rom Folders](https://github.com/OnionUI/Onion/wiki/Emulators#rom-folders---quick-reference) table).
- Despite its name, the `.tmp_update` folder must stay on your SD card.

</td><td>

If you experience any issues during the install, try copying over the installation  
files again and use another upgrade option (you can skip copying the `BIOS`,  
`Icons`, and `Themes` folders).

If you still have issues after trying the reinstall option, you may have to reformat  
your SD card (remember to backup the `Roms` and `Saves` folders).
