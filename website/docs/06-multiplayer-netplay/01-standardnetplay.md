*Fight against your friends remotely!*

**Standard Netplay:** a feature to create and join Retroarch multiplayer sessions easily. Each game you'll create will be available over internet and making it easy for your friends to join in your game.



## Features

- Easy host setup

- Optimized Retroarch configuration

- Automatic core selection for Netplay

- CPU performance boots when it's needed


## Enabling Easy Netplay

You'll currently find the quick join feature in GLO. GLO can be opened by browsing to the rom you want to play and pressing Y. 


### As the host

To host a rom you'll first need to make sure you're using a core that can support netplay. Cores can be verified using [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y1esG3HcNagPG8cy-ulZK_mhhUb93pqG5_XEtRRgKQ4/edit#gid=0)

1. Find the rom in the Games submenu

2. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to open GLO

3. Choose `Netplay` -> `Host` -> `Standard Netplay (use current wifi)`
 
Your Onion netplay session is now ready to be joined from your local home network or even on the other side of the world.


### As the client

To join a host, it's a little easier. Currently you'll start the hotspot client connection using the same process as the host. 

1. Select the same game as the host

2. Press <kbd>Y</kbd> to open GLO

3. Choose `Netplay` -> `Join` -> `Standard Netplay (use current wifi)`

4. Press Menu + Select to display the retroarch menu, go into Netplay and then click on :
	- `Refresh Netplay Host List` -> to display hosted games over internet
	- `Refresh Netplay Lan List` -> to display hosted games over your local network
	
5. Select your target server in the list.
