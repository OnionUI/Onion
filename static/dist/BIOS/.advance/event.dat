; EVENT.DAT Version 0.4
;
; Data for the "Event" and "Safe Quit" systems of AdvanceMAME
;
; This is the logic behind the "Safe Quit" engine:
; 
; IF (number of credits in game = 0) AND (game is in demo mode)
;       enable the safequit (game can exit when asked)
; ELSE
;       disable the safequit (game will show a confirmation screen)
;
; This file can be edited with a text editor, but keep the same format:
; all fields are separated by a colon (:)
;
; <gamename>:
; <event>:<cpu>:<address>:<action>:<mask>:<result>
; [repeat the above as many times as necessary]
;
; The rule apply to "gamename" and any clone. To override the definition
; for a clone put it after (and not before) the parent definition.
;
; For <action> = match
; Load <gamename> and get the value inside <address> on CPU <cpu> RAM area.
; Perform an AND operation with <mask> and compare with <result>.
; If they DO match for at least one second the  event <event> is TRUE.
;
; For <action> = nomatch
; Load <gamename> and get the value inside <address> on CPU <cpu> RAM area.
; Perform an AND operation with <mask> and compare with <result>.
; If they DO NOT match for at least one second the event <event> is TRUE.
;
; For <action> = on
; The result is always TRUE.
;
; For <action> = off
; The result is always FALSE.
;
; To enable the event, all listed actions must be TRUE.
; An event assumes the value FALSE immediately. To assume the value TRUE
; it's necessary ** ALL ITS COMPONENTS ** are TRUE for at least 1 second.
;
; The field <event> can be "zerocoin" or "demomode" for the "Safe Quit"
; system or "event1", "event2", ..., "event14" for the "Event" system.
;
; The event "zerocoin" tests the "waiting coins" (not yet played).
; I searched for addresses corresponding to coin slot 1 only, but you are
; welcome to include addresses for other coin slots too.
;
; The event "demomode" tests the current game status. In some games it's
; necessary more than one address to determine the current game status.
; I call them "event components": a game is in play mode if any of the
; demomode components are FALSE. When all are TRUE together for at least
; one second then the event "demomode" is TRUE.
;
; Depending on the dipswitch setting about number of coin slots and
; simultaneous players, the address of the waiting coins may differ;
; an example of this behaviour is dino. The addresses in this file were
; found on games with 2 simultaneous players and one active coin slot.
; This doesn't mean they won't work on games configured for 3, 4 or more
; simultaneous players.

; Needs special attention, to correctly identify zerocoin and demomode in
; this game was a hard task. Here's what I got so far:
;
; When the master event zerocoin becomes FALSE and then TRUE (when one
; credit is used) this will obligate all demomode components to be TRUE.
; We check for an inserted coin watching CPU (1) (0x82c9) for 0x39 - that's
; "Konami" speech.
;
; When a player dies, the message insert coin appears. This corresponds to 
; the value 0x72 in 0x5c22 (P1), 0x5c42 (P2), 0x5c62 (P3), 0x5c82 (P4) and
; these are the only reliable indicators of game over without remaining coins.
;
; If these addresses are 0x72 all together at same time then the game is
; over without any coins left.
