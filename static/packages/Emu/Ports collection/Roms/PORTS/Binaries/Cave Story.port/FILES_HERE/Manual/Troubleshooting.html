- Troubleshooting -<br>
<br>
The following are possible issues that may occur while playing the game.<br>
If you run across problems not listed here, feel free to contact the author via email or on Studio Pixel's message board.<br>

<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* I get an error message saying, "Cannot read generic file."<br>
(Translator's note: Error messages may appear in Japanese.)</font><br>
<br>
- Try redownloading the game.<br>
The files may have been corrupted.<br>
<br>
- Try using a different uncompression program.<br>
Some uncompression software may alter the directory structure so that the program is unable to find certain files.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* The game runs extremely slowly.</font><br>
<br>
- Try changing the screen mode in DoConfig.exe.<br>
There shouldn't be any problems if your computer is fast enough,<br>
but the most appropriate screen mode can vary depending on the computer.<br>
(Full-screen is recommended.)<br>
<br>
- Try changing the "color quality" in your Display Properties.<br>
Depending on your computer, the number of colors displayed can significantly affect the game speed.<br>
24-bit or 32-bit color is recommended.<br>
<br>
- Try adjusting your DirectX settings.<br>
You can adjust DirectX settings using the diagnostic tool "dxdiag.exe".<br>
Select "Run..." from the Start Menu and enter "dxdiag".<br>
For detailed instructions on how to use the tool, consult the program's "Help" function.<br>
<br>
- Try adjusting your hardware acceleration.<br>
You can change the settings of your hardware acceleration<br>
by opening Display Properties -&gt; Settings -&gt; Advanced and selecting the "Troubleshoot" or "Performance" tag.<br>
<br>
- Try updating your drivers.<br>
Some problems may be resolved if you update your graphics drivers.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* The background music cuts off.</font><br>
<br>
- Try adjusting your audio hardware acceleration.<br>
You may be able to fix this problem by adjusting the hardware acceleration for your sound card.<br>
Open Control Panel -&gt; Sounds and Audio Devices -&gt; Audio -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Performance.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* When I press two keys on the keyboard at once, only one registers.</font><br>
<br>
- Change the keys in DoConfig.exe.<br>
Some keyboards fail to register the down-arrow key if "Z" and the right-arrow key are pressed.<br>
If this is the case, please play using the "&lt; &gt; /" setting.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* When playing with a gamepad, the main character moves in directions that aren't being pressed.</font><br>
<br>
- Please restart the game without any buttons on the gamepad being pressed.<br>
If you start the game while holding a directional button,<br>
the game will have problems recognizing directional input after that.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* Saving doesn't work.</font><br>
<br>
- Save data is stored in the file "Profile.dat", created in the same directory as Doukutsu.exe.<br>
If this file cannot be written to, saving will not be possible.<br>
Check that "Profile.dat" is not set to "Read-only" and that the game is not being run from a read-only drive.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* Running in 256-color mode</font><br>
<br>
- This game was created assuming an operating environment with 16-bit color or higher.<br>
Playing with only 256 colors will result in abrupt color shifts and missing portions of some pictures, among other problems.<br>
I have no plans to correct this.<br>
<br>
<font color="#dd0000">* The "error" file</font><br>
<br>
If certain errors cause the game to quit, a file labeled "error" will sometimes be created in the same directory<br>
as the executable (Doukutsu.exe).  This file can be deleted safely.<br>
<br>
