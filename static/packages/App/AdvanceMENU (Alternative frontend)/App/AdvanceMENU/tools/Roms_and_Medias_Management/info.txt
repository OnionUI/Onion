Tips: 
=====
 - "mp4_to_mng" script has been created to easily convert videos from standard scraping to AdvanceMenu particular video format (mng + mp3). It's a good way to import external systems such as GBA in your AdvanceMenu.
 - It's probably better to run "move_incompatible_Roms" script first and then "move_roms_without_preview"  because it will avoid to try to scrap all the "_RomsWithoutPreview"   folder when it is not necessary for incompatible roms.
