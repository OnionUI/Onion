Copy the palettes folder into your BIOS folder. Then set GB Colorization to Custom in Core Options as per the settings below. Make sure you use the appropriate corresponding overlay for your palette file (i.e., DMG or GBP), otherwise the output will look strange. The default Retroarch file name for custom palettes is default.pal

Recommended Retroarch settings are:

1. Core Options:

    GB Colorization > Custom
    Interframe Blending > Simple (Note: Don't use any of the "LCD Ghosting" presets as they produce additional graphical artifacts in dark areas)


2. Video Settings:

    Integer Scale OFF

    Keep Aspect Ratio ON

    Image Interpolation > Bicubic
