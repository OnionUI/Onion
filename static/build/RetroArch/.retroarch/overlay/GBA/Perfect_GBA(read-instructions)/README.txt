The recommended Retroarch settings:

1. Core Options:

    Video > Color Correction > OFF

    Video > Interframe Blending > Simple (NOTE: If you don't like the image ghosting, turn it OFF, but you may see flickering elements in games.)


2. Video Settings:

    Integer Scale OFF

    Keep Aspect Ratio ON

    Image Interpolation > Bicubic

    Video Filter > GBA > Filter for overlays > GBAOffset.filt
