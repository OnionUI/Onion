description = "A PC Engine (PCE) core forked from Mednafen's PCE-Fast emulator, this core is a bit faster than the non-Fast flavor at the cost of some accuracy/compatibility. In addition to PCE, PCE-CD, TurboGrafx 16 and TurboGrafx 16 CD, this core also differs from the Beetle-PCE-Fast version in its support for the SuperGrafx console. In general, most users are better off with the non-Fast Beetle-PCE core, but if they cannot maintain full speed with it, this is a good second choice. If this core is too slow, as well, then Beetle-PCE-Fast is the last, best choice."
