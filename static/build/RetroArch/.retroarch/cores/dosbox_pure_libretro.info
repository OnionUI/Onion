description = "A port of the mature and well-known DOSBox emulator to libretro with a goal of simplicty and ease of use. This core includes a streamlined workflow for launching games directly from ZIP archives (including disk images therein) with automated mapping of controls to gamepads and a native onscreen keyboard. This is a good core for most users who just want to play games and are not looking for a traditional DOS experience."
