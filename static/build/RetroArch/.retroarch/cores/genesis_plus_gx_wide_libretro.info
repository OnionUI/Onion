description = "A port of the Genesis Plus GX emulator to libretro but with the addition of a widescreen hack that can be applied to games automatically (not all games play nicely with the effect, but a surprisingly large number are pretty good). Otherwise identical to the normal Genesis Plus GX libretro core, this core is a great choice for any 8- and 16-bit Sega consoles, from Master System to Game Gear to Genesis/Mega Drive to Sega CD. Only the 32X is not supported. The core is both fast and highly accurate and it benefits from a tight and feature-filled integration with libretro."
