description = "A port of the Caprice32 emulator to libretro. This core emulates the Amstrad CPC 8-bit home computer series, including the CPC464, CPC664, CPC128, CPC6128+ and GX4000 models, with a high degree of accuracy and compatibility. While the core's autoloaunch options do a pretty good job of guessing the command required to launch a game, users may specify a command to be executed on launch via an m3u playlist. See the core's documentation for further details."
