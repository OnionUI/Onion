description = "A port of 'SVN' fork of the mature and well-known DOSBox emulator to libretro. This core is up-to-date with the latest DOSBox-SVN trunk and allows on-the-fly configuration and different sync methods (including the potential for perfect sync without tearing on VRR monitors). This core provides a more traditional DOSBox experience vs the DOSBox-Pure core, which is focused on providing a turnkey, game-focused libretro experience."
