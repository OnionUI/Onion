description = "This is the fastest PC Engine emulator forked from the Mednafen codebase, and it includes an optimized renderer for the PSP's hardware. This speed comes at a cost, though, and a few games don't work with this core. For this reason, if a device can run the non-Fast core at full speed, that one is propably a better choice. Additionally, this core differs from the Beetle-SuperGrafx core only insofar as it does not support SuperGrafx games, so again, unless you need to use this core for a specific reason, you may as well get the added compatibility of the other PCE-compatible cores."
