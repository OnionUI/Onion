description = "This is a test core that is mostly useful to developers. It is intended as a reference for core authors and a functionality check for frontend authors. This core demonstrates how to create a hardware-rendered core--in this case, using OpenGL/ES--in a libretro context. This core can load basic *.obj 3D models, which can then be rotated and viewed using the retropad controls."
