# Libretro Features
supports_no_game = "false"

description = "A rewrite of the original NeoCD emulator for SNK's NeoGeo CD console, ported to libretro. This core is intended to improve the accuracy of the original project, while still maintaining full/usable speed on low-powered hardware, such as the Raspberry Pi. It is easier to load games with than some of the other, more complex cores that support the NeoGeo CD platform, such as MAME and FBNeo."
